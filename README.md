# jsfx-guified

###Description
This is a collection of jsfx with GUIs.
The GUIs were written using [Geraint Luff's API](https://github.com/geraintluff/jsfx-ui-lib). The GUI is dependent on the /ui-lib folder, so don't delete that.
_This is a work in progress, so there might be changes and more plugins to be guified._


There is a theme switcher and the plugin description on the second tab if you click "â†’" on the upper right corner of the plugin.
There could be some bugs, so please report them.

Installation:
-drop the folder in your Reaper Effects folder.
-the plugins will have a "- GUI" suffix in REAPER to distinguish them from the originals.
