# jsfx-guified

## Description
This is a collection of JSFX with GUIs.
The GUIs were written using [Geraint Luff's API](https://github.com/geraintluff/jsfx-ui-lib). The GUI is dependent on the `ui-lib` folder, so don't delete that. Some functions were added by me, so you'll need the `ui-lib` folder included in this project for them to work.
There could be some bugs, so please report them, preferrably at the [REAPER forum](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=246995).

**This is a work in progress, so there might be changes and more plugins to be guified.**

### Themes
There is a theme switcher and the plugin description on the second tab if you click "â†’" on the upper right corner of the plugin.
The themes are bitmaps located in `/ui-lib/bitmap/` and can be changed to your liking.

### Installation:
Drop the `JPH` folder in your Reaper Effects folder.
The plugins will have a `- GUI` suffix in REAPER to distinguish them from the originals.

Right now the collection includes:
